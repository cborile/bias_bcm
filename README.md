# Bias and Identifiability in the Bounded Confidence Model


This repository contains the codes used to conduct the experiments and to generate the figure of the paper _Bias and Identifiability in the Bounded Confidence Model_.

Scripts:
- `src/bcm.py` generates the trajectories of the sBCM.
- `src/experiments_sbcm.py` runs the experiments that estimate the bounded confidence bound of the sBCM and its bias.
- `src/nll_minimization.py` computes and minimizes the negative log-likelihood of the sBCM.
- `src/experiments_rasch.py` runs the experiments that estimate the person ability parameter in a Rasch model and its bias.
- `src/mle_mu_over_N_mu-10_trials.py` and `src/mle_mu_over_N_T-10_trials.py` run the experiments that estimate the convergence rate parameter of the sBCM and its bias.


Notebooks:
- `notebooks/bias_sbcm_rasch.ipynb` analyzes the output of  `src/experiments_rasch.py` and `src/experiments_sbcm.py`, and the corresponding figures
- `notebooks/generate_dynamics.ipynb` analyzes the trajectories generated by the sBCM
- `notebooks/likelihood_derivative.ipynb` computes and plot the derivative of the log likelihood in $\varepsilon$  
- `notebooks/eps-mu-surface_plots.ipynb` plots for joint estimation of $\varepsilon, \mu$
- `notebooks/bias_var_plots.ipynb`  plots for bias and variance results in the sBCM (run after `src/experiments_sbcm.py`, `src/mle_mu_over_N_mu-10_trials.py`, and `src/mle_mu_over_N_T-10_trials.py`)
